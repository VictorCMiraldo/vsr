In the remote host; we should create a luks encrypted container
to be used as follows:

## One-time setup

First, create the container with x gigabytes

```
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=path/to/CONTAINER bs=1M count=$(( x * 1024 )) status=progress
# cryptsetup -y luksFormat path/to/CONTAINER
# cryptsetup luksOpen path/to/CONTAINER volume1
```

Now we have to make a filesystem:

```
# mkfs.ext4 -j /dev/mapper/volume1
```

Mount the container and create a directory for a user

```
# mkdir /mnt/vault
# mount /dev/mapper/volume1 /mnt/vault
# mkdir /mnt/vault/backup
# chown victor /mnt/vault/backup
```

And we are good to go.

## Opening and Closing the Container

Ass two scripts like following:

```
#! /bin/bash

# openContainer.sh

# Open the luks container;
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen CONTAINER volume1
sudo mount /dev/mapper/volume1 /mnt/vault

# Add links to make it easy
ln -fs /mnt/vault/backup ./
```


```
#! /bin/bash

# closeContainer.sh

# Remove links
rm backup

# unmount and close the container
sudo umount /mnt/vault
sudo cryptsetup luksClose volume1
```
