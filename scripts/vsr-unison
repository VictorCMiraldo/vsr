# So... unison is VERY picky with its versions. Not only all replicas
# must have the same version of unison, the binaries themselves must
# have been compiled with the same version of the OCaml compiler. 
# This is nuts and horrible!
#
# The best solution seems to be the one outline in: 
#   https://askubuntu.com/questions/1234767/can-i-install-unison-for-ubuntu-18-04-lts-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts
# Which is: purge current instalation everywhere, remove
# the .unison/{ar,fp}* cache files, donwload the Debian version
# on all replicas:
#
#  $ wget http://ftp.fr.debian.org/debian/pool/main/u/unison/unison_2.48.4-1+b1_amd64.deb
#  $ sudo dpkg -i unison_2.48.4-1+b1_amd64.deb
#
# finally, install aptitude and put unison on hold to defer upgrading the
# binary automagically
#
#  $ sudo aptitude hold unison
#
